# UFO-sightings

### Overview
---
The purpose of this project was to learn how to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Customizing our webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. 

In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. Finally, we use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view, includes filters, images, and a synopsis of the topic.
